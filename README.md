## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler

## Setup

See this [tutorial](http://leveton.blogspot.com/2013/08/using-custom-sorting-control-to-demo.html) for an explanation of how I put it together and what I use it for.

Drag the 'MELSortingView' folder into your project.  Make sure 'Copy items if needed' and 'Create groups' is checked.

Add the object to your view controller specifying the frame size and number of sortable views that you need.  You can then add numbered labels.

    MELSortingView *sortView = [[MELSortingView alloc]initWithFrame:self.view.frame andNumberOfViews:6];
    sortView.delegate = self;
    [sortView addLabels];
    [self.view addSubview:sortView];

Receive delegate notifications whenever a view is moved or two views have swapped places.  These methods tell you the positions of the moving views from 0..n.

    - (void)view:(MELSortingView *)sortingView wasMovedWithView:(UIView *)aView
    - (void)view:(MELSortingView *)sortingView didAlternateView:(UIView *)departureView withView:(UIView *)destinationView
