## Requirements

* Xcode 4.5 or higher
* Apple LLVM compiler

## Setup

See this [tutorial](http://leveton.blogspot.com/2013/08/using-custom-sorting-control-to-demo.html) for an explanation of how I put it together and what I use it for.

Drag the 'MELSortingView' folder into your project.  Make sure 'Copy items if needed' and 'Create groups' is checked.

Add the object to your view controller specifying the x and y offsets, the width, and the number of sortable views that you need.  You can also add numbered labels.  To stay in tune with Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines,](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/) the view must be at least 100px wide.

``` objc
MELSortingView *sortView = [MELSortingView sortingViewWithViews:6 XOffset:0 YOffset:0 andWidth:self.view.frame.size.width];
sortView.delegate = self;
[sortView addLabels];
[self.view addSubview:sortView];
```

Receive delegate notifications whenever a view is moved or two views have swapped places.  These methods tell you the positions of the moving views from 0..n.

``` objc
- (void)view:(MELSortingView *)sortingView wasMovedWithView:(UIView *)aView
- (void)view:(MELSortingView *)sortingView didAlternateView:(UIView *)departureView withView:(UIView *)destinationView
```
